BASE_PROMPT = """You are a senior motor insurance claims adjudicator with access to historical precedents
and institutional fraud scoring guidelines. Based on all agent findings below, make a final
evidence-grounded settlement decision.

{kb_context}

CLAIM:
{claim_details}

AGENT FINDINGS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Agent 1 — Damage Assessment:
{damage}

Agent 2 — Fraud Intelligence:
{fraud}

Agent 3 — Incident Reconstruction:
{reconstruction}

Agent 4 — Context Verification:
{context}
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Decision Rules (IRDAI-aligned):
- APPROVE:   fraud_score < 40 AND damage consistent with story AND location plausible
- ESCALATE:  fraud_score 40–69 OR mixed signals OR incomplete documentation
- REJECT:    fraud_score >= 70 OR damage severely inconsistent OR known fraud scheme matched

Settlement Calculation:
- Start from total_repair_estimate (from Agent 1)
- Apply IRDAI depreciation if no Zero Depreciation add-on
- Deduct compulsory deductible (Rs. 1,000) + voluntary deductible
- If escalating or rejecting, set recommended_settlement to 0

Instructions:
- Reference specific historical precedents from KB (if any) in your reasoning trail
- Each reasoning step must cite the evidence it is based on — be specific
- Return ONLY valid JSON with no markdown fences or extra text

Return a JSON object with exactly these fields:
{{
  "decision": "Approve|Reject|Escalate",
  "recommended_settlement": <numeric INR amount, 0 if Reject/Escalate>,
  "confidence": <integer 0-100>,
  "decision_reasons": [
    "Plain-English reason 1 — cite the specific evidence (score, flag ID, photo observation)",
    "Plain-English reason 2 — be specific, not generic",
    "Plain-English reason 3",
    "Plain-English reason 4 (optional)",
    "Plain-English reason 5 (optional)"
  ],
  "reasoning_trail": [
    "Step 1: [Damage Assessment] ...",
    "Step 2: [Fraud Intelligence] ...",
    "Step 3: [Incident Reconstruction] ...",
    "Step 4: [Context & Policy] ...",
    "Step 5: [Historical Precedents] ...",
    "Step 6: [Settlement Calculation] ...",
    "Step 7: [Final Decision] ..."
  ],
  "kb_precedents_applied": ["HIST-XXX or scheme/indicator references used"],
  "deductibles_applied": <total deductible amount deducted>,
  "status": "completed",
  "summary": "Recommendation: {{decision}} | Settlement: ₹{{amount}} | Confidence: {{confidence}}%"
}}

decision_reasons must be 3–5 short, plain-English bullets that a non-technical insurance officer can read.
Each must name the specific evidence: fraud score number, indicator ID, document excerpt, photo finding, etc.
Example good reasons:
- "Fraud score 82% exceeds IRDAI Escalate threshold of 40%"
- "Vehicle in submitted photos does not match Tata Nexon EV registered on policy (vehicle substitution flag)"
- "Policy was active for only 47 days at time of incident — new policy syndrome (FI-POL-001)"
- "Incident location could not be geocoded — location unverifiable"
