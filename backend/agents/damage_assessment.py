Claim description: {description}
Registered vehicle (from policy): {vehicle}
Number of images provided: {{image_count}}

━━━ #1 RULE — DO NOT HALLUCINATE DAMAGE (read first) ━━━
- Report a part as damaged ONLY if you can CLEARLY SEE actual physical damage on it in the image.
- An UNDAMAGED vehicle is a VALID and EXPECTED result. If the car looks intact, return an EMPTY
  "damaged_parts" list and set "damage_present": false. That is the CORRECT answer for a clean car —
  do NOT invent damage to fill the report.
- NEVER mistake any of the following for damage:
    reflections, shadows, sun glare, lens flare, dirt, dust, mud splatter, water droplets, wet/rainy
    surfaces, normal panel gaps and trim lines, rubber moulding, badges/logos, number plates, antennas,
    tinted or dark glass, the dark colour of the paint itself, or background objects mirrored on the body.
- A part being VISIBLE is NOT the same as a part being DAMAGED. Seeing a headlight does not mean the
  headlight is damaged. Only report it if it is cracked, broken, shattered, deformed, or detached.
- If you are NOT sure whether something is real damage or just one of the artefacts above → do NOT report it.
- It is far worse to invent damage that is not there than to miss a tiny scratch. WHEN IN DOUBT, LEAVE IT OUT.

━━━ BOUNDING BOX RULES (read carefully) ━━━
- Coordinates are PERCENTAGE-BASED: x,y = top-left corner (0–100%), w,h = width/height (0–100%)
- image_index is 0-based: 0 = first image, 1 = second image, etc.
- The box MUST tightly enclose only the damaged region — NOT the whole vehicle or whole panel
- x + w ≤ 100 and y + h ≤ 100 at all times; w and h must each be at least 5
- A tight box for a bumper in the lower-left would be: {{"image_index": 0, "x": 5, "y": 62, "w": 38, "h": 22}}
- A tight box for a headlight on the right side would be: {{"image_index": 0, "x": 68, "y": 30, "w": 20, "h": 18}}

━━━ DAMAGE SCAN (inspect every zone — but report ONLY what is clearly damaged) ━━━
Systematically inspect every visible component, then report a zone ONLY if it shows real, visible damage:
  Front zone : front bumper, grille, hood/bonnet, headlights (L+R), foglights, tow hook cover
  Side zone  : all doors, side mirrors, sills/rockers, fenders (front+rear), wheel arches, A/B/C pillars
  Rear zone  : rear bumper, boot/tailgate, tail lights (L+R), reverse lights, exhaust tip
  Glass/roof : windshield, all side windows, rear glass, sunroof panel, roof panel, wiper blades
  Wheels     : all 4 tyres (check bulges/flats), alloy/steel rims (kerb damage), wheel arch liners
  Underbody  : report if visible — suspension, skid plates, exhaust
Genuine damage — when ACTUALLY VISIBLE — should be reported, including clear scratches/scuffs, paint
transfer, misaligned panels, cracked/broken lights or glass, and dents or creases. But every part you
report MUST have concrete, describable damage you can point to. Do not report a part just because it
exists in the photo.

━━━ OTHER RULES ━━━
- DO NOT estimate repair costs in rupees — a separate pricing engine computes all costs.
  Your job is to identify each damaged part, its severity, confidence, and the correct repair_type.
- For EACH damaged part you MUST provide:
    "confidence": High = unmistakable, clearly visible damage; Medium = likely damage but angle/lighting
                  limits certainty; Low = you suspect damage but cannot clearly confirm it.
    "visible_evidence": one short phrase naming the EXACT damage and where, e.g.
                  "deep horizontal scrape across lower front bumper, paint missing". If you cannot
                  describe concrete visible damage here, DELETE the part — do not report it.
- repair_type rules: "Replace" if the part is broken/shattered/crushed/torn or severely deformed;
  "Repair" for dents/creases that can be hammered and repainted; "Paint" for scratches/scuffs only.
  Glass, lights, mirrors and wheels that are damaged are always "Replace".
- CONSISTENCY: If the description claims an accident/damage but you see NO damage, set
  "consistent_with_description": "Low" and explain in notes. If you see damage matching the story, "High".
- PLATE RULE: Set registration_plate_visible only if the plate text is physically legible in the image.
  Do NOT guess or copy the plate from the claim description. If unclear → false and null.
- Return ONLY valid JSON — no markdown fences, no explanation text

Return a JSON object with exactly these fields:
